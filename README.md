# Note Taker Starter Code
## discription
I took the starter code for a note taking app and created a api routes for calls to retieve notes for saved iles and calls the post notes to json to save them.
I created a server.js that connected all of the files together the index.html the js and the css with get request so that when entered the websites http it would load. I created get request to route the json data back to the index.html file. and also a post route to reicieve data from the file when a user writes a note.
This app was created using express.js.
